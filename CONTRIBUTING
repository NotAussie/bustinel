# Contributing to Bustinel

G'day, thanks for showing interest in contributing to Bustinel, below you'll find information on how to contribute!

## Getting Started

We provide a docker compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) to help keep environments consistent. To spin up a development environment, simply run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will start up PostgreSQL and FerretDB alongside the application itself.

## Making Changes

When making changes, please ensure the following:

1. Follow the existing code style and conventions.
2. Document any new/changed functions with a clear and short summary. (E.g. "Retrieves GTFS static data and stores the parsed data into the global app storage")
3. All commits should follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
4. All changes should be thoroughly tested before being submitted.

## Submitting Changes

Once you've completed your changes, please submit a pull request. Be sure to include a summary of your changes and any relevant issue numbers. Before a change is merged a review will be conducted on your changes, if any changes are requested they must be addressed before the pull request can be merged.

## Publishing Versions

>[!WARNING]
> This segment is intended for project leaders.

To create a new version simply use Git tags. For example:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
```

Our CI/CD pipeline will automatically build and publish to the GitHub container registery alongside allowing pkg.go.dev to index our new documentation.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that all contributors are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/NotAussie/bustinel/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT) while participating in the project.
