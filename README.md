# Bustinel

A lightweight microservice for archiving GTFS-RT trips.

## üí° Features

- Written in Go, performing ~10x faster than both `v1` and `v2`.
- Forward-compatible-only changes.

## ‚ùì Why Create This?

Bustinel came about as a solution to a niche problem of mine, I'm a photographer and public transport enthusiast. And my local agency _(Adelaide Metro)_ has a few experimental vehicles they operate periodically, my goal has been to photograph and ride these buses, annoying due to their inconsistent schedule I had to get creative to track them down... this being the result of getting creative.

## ‚ú® Start Tracking

To start tracking first you'll need either a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) installation and either [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or [FerretDB](https://ferretdb.com/).

### üêã Docker Compose

The compose file below features a [FerretDB](https://ferretdb.com/) instance and Bustinel _(v3)_ instance in a production ready state.

```yml
services:
  postgres:
    image: ghcr.io/ferretdb/postgres-documentdb:17-0.106.0-ferretdb-2.5.0
    restart: on-failure
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=bustinel
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=atotallysecurepassword
      - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  ferretdb:
